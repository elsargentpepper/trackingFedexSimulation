## Lessons Learned

I was able to take a lot of theorical knowledge regarding accesibility to practice, creating three different CSS stylesheets to adapt views accordingly with viewport width. This project had the challenge of bewing designed with mobile first in mind. 

I also learned a lot about the integration with webpack and babel, to prepare the project for distribution, including several plugins to include assets like images and the integration of the CSS files.
