## Lessons Learned

I was able to take a lot of theorical knowledge regarding accesibility to practice, creating three different CSS stylesheets to adapt views accordingly with viewport width. 

I also learned a lot about the integration with webpack and babel, to prepare the project for distribution, including several plugins to include assets like images and the integration of the CSS files.
